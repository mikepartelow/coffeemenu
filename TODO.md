# TODO
- `menu [single site]` renders just one site
- we want `["ChildTextJoin", "-", "h3", ".origin"] for https://jbccoffeeroasters.com/product-category/coffee/ to get e.g. "El Amigo - Mexico"
- unit tests for site.eFunc
- filter out noise like t-shirts and mugs
- normalize names like COLOMBIA and Colombia
- do better with SQ1, possibly by following links
- follow links to scrape more info like price, tasting notes
- cmd/menu/menu_test.go
